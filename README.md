# Nuclei-detection-using-Machine-Learning

Nuclei detection in histological images using machine learning, to train the model I use a dataset of labelled images of 
negative and positive samples, the size of each sample is 20x20 pixel.
The dataset contain 1186 samples.
I choose Decision tree classifier as a model because of it's accuracy, I will add a file of the gridsearch results.
A sliding window (20x20 pixel) will predict the detection or not of a nuclei cell.
The image colon_normal_rose100_DECISION_TREE.png is the result of model's prediction.
